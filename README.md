# ec-1

The Educational Computer, Model 1 - project from "Etudes for Programmers".

`ec-1` is a computer simulator. It loads ALF (absolute load file) produced
by an user or the EC Loader (TODO: missing link) with an input stream for
the program and produces an output stream based on the specification (TODO:
missing link).
