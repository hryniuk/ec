# ec

The Educational Computer, Model 1 - project from the "Etudes for Programmers"
book.

`ec` is a computer simulator. Like an every standard computer program it
transforms data. As an input it accepts **ALF** (_absolute load file_; see
below) and **input stream**. It prints an **output stream** - the result of a
given program.

As I've moved to other projects, this one has been archived.
Implemented OP Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/hryniuk/ec/issues/1).

## Building

A default `Makefile`'s job builds a debug version and run both unit and
functional/system tests:

```shell
$ make
```

If you want to build it only, you can run:

```shell
$ make build
```

or just use `cargo`.

## Running

```shell
$ ./ec
Usage: ./ec [options]

Options:
    -q, --quiet         disable logs
    -v, --verbose       be verbose
    -t, --trace         be even more verbose - enables TRACE log level
    -f, --alf PATH      path to ALF
```

## ALF

ALF example:

```
00004004040000005400442E010020
END0040
```

**ALF** (_absolute load file_) is a text file that describes a content of **EC memory** before program
execution. It can be produced by the user, the **ecasm** (_assembler_) or the
**ecld** (loader) (both may be found in [EC Loader
repository](git@github.com:hryniuk/asm-ec.git)). It consist of **records**
explained below.

### Record

A single line of **ALF**, except the last one, is called a **record**. It
consists of:
* **checksum** (1st character)
* **sequence number** (characters 2-4)
* list of **entries**

**Checksum** is calculated by adding all the other hexadecimal digits and
ignoring the carryout.

**Sequence number** is a consecutive number, starting from **000**. As it uses
3 digits, the maximal value is `0xFFF`, hence single ALF may contain up to `4096`
records.

> All numbers present in a **record** are hexadecimal.

For example, in the **record** presented above:

```
0 000 4004040000005400442E010020
```

**checksum** equals `0` (cause sum of the rest of digits equals `48 = 0x30`) and
**sequence number** equals `000`. The last part is a list of **entries**.

The last **record** of **ALF** always starts with "END" string and contains 4
digits of **start address** (`0x40` in example).

#### Entries

Single **entry** describes a continuous chunk of **EC's memory**. It includes
three things:

* **count** - one digit; how many character positions in memory are to be filled by
  the data
* **address** - 4 digits; hexadecimal start address for the data in memory
* **data** - 2 digits for each characters to be filled (so 2 * **count** in
  overall).

There are two entries in the sample **record**, each with **count** = `4`:

```
4 0040 40 00 00 05
4 0044 2E 01 00 20
```

So this record translates to the following memory content:

```
address:    ... 0x40 0x41 0x42 0x43 0x44 0x45 0x46 0x47 ...
character:  ... 0x40 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x2E 0x01 0x00 0x20 ...
```
